# M01: MVP Foundation - Core Infrastructure PRD

## Milestone Overview
**Milestone:** M01_MVP_FOUNDATION_CORE_INFRASTRUCTURE  
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks  
**Priority:** Critical - Foundation for all subsequent work  
**Success Criteria:** Functional MCP server that can handle basic protocol operations

## Business Objectives
- Establish the foundational architecture for Meta-MCP Server
- Implement core MCP protocol to enable basic client/server communication
- Create modular, testable codebase structure
- Validate technical approach and architecture decisions

## User Stories

### US-M01-001: As a developer, I want to start the Meta-MCP server locally
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Server starts with `meta-mcp` command
- Accepts configuration via command-line flags
- Provides clear startup/shutdown logging
- Handles graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT)

### US-M01-002: As a developer, I want the server to implement core MCP protocol
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Supports JSON-RPC 2.0 message format
- Implements initialize/initialized handshake
- Handles basic protocol negotiation
- Returns proper error responses for unsupported methods

### US-M01-003: As a developer, I want structured project organization
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clear separation of concerns (cmd/, internal/, pkg/)
- Modular component design
- Comprehensive unit test structure
- CI/CD pipeline setup

### US-M01-004: As a developer, I want basic configuration management
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Load configuration from JSON file
- Support environment variable overrides
- Validate configuration on startup
- Provide configuration schema documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **MCP Protocol Handler**
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 parser/serializer
   - Message routing system
   - Protocol version negotiation
   - Error handling framework

2. **Server Infrastructure**
   - TCP/HTTP server setup
   - Connection lifecycle management
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Logging and monitoring hooks

3. **Configuration System**
   - JSON configuration loader
   - Schema validation
   - Environment variable support
   - Default configuration values

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Unit test infrastructure
   - Integration test setup
   - Mock MCP client for testing
   - Coverage reporting

### Dependencies
- Go 1.24+
- Standard library only (no external dependencies for M01)
- Testing: Go's built-in testing package

### Architecture Decisions
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clear boundaries between core logic and adapters
- **Interface-First Design**: All major components behind interfaces
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based DI for testability
- **Error Handling**: Wrapped errors with context throughout

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Server starts and accepts connections on configured port
- [ ] Implements MCP initialize/initialized handshake
- [ ] Handles unknown method requests with proper errors
- [ ] Loads and validates configuration from file
- [ ] Provides structured logging with levels
- [ ] Graceful shutdown on signals

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] 70%+ unit test coverage for core components
- [ ] All code passes `go fmt`, `go vet`, and `golint`
- [ ] Documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] Performance: <10ms response time for protocol messages
- [ ] Memory usage: <50MB for idle server

### Technical Debt Items
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure code quality tools (golangci-lint)
- [ ] Create developer documentation
- [ ] Set up release process

## Out of Scope
- MCP server connections (M02)
- AI integration (M03)
- Workflow execution (M03)
- Production features (M04)

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| MCP spec ambiguity | High | Create comprehensive protocol tests |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Design for concurrent operations from start |
| Complex error handling | Medium | Implement error framework early |

## Success Metrics
- All acceptance criteria met
- Zero critical bugs
- Setup time for new developers <30 minutes
- Clean architecture validated by team review

## Dependencies on Other Milestones
- None - this is the foundation milestone

## Release Plan
1. Week 1-2: Core protocol implementation
2. Week 3-4: Server infrastructure and configuration
3. Week 5: Testing and documentation
4. Week 6: Bug fixes and polish
