# M02: Connection Orchestration PRD

## Milestone Overview
**Milestone:** M02_CONNECTION_ORCHESTRATION  
**Duration:** 4-5 weeks  
**Priority:** Critical - Core value proposition  
**Success Criteria:** Successfully connect to and orchestrate multiple MCP servers

## Business Objectives
- Enable core value proposition of aggregating multiple MCP servers
- Implement robust connection management for reliability
- Create dynamic command discovery and routing
- Provide foundation for workflow orchestration

## User Stories

### US-M02-001: As a developer, I want to connect to multiple STDIO-based MCP servers
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Spawn subprocess MCP servers via configuration
- Manage stdin/stdout pipes for each server
- Handle server lifecycle (start, stop, restart)
- Monitor server health and availability

### US-M02-002: As a developer, I want to connect to HTTP/SSE-based MCP servers
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Establish HTTP connections to remote servers
- Support Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Handle authentication (API keys, OAuth)
- Implement connection pooling and retry logic

### US-M02-003: As a developer, I want automatic command discovery
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Query connected servers for available tools/resources
- Build unified command catalog
- Cache capabilities with TTL
- Handle capability changes dynamically

### US-M02-004: As a developer, I want intelligent request routing
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Route requests to appropriate MCP server
- Handle server-specific parameter translation
- Aggregate responses from multiple servers
- Provide clear error attribution

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

1. **Connection Manager**
   - Server registry with health tracking
   - Connection pool management
   - Lifecycle control (start/stop/restart)
   - Connection state machine

2. **STDIO Connector**
   - Process spawning with `os/exec`
   - Bidirectional pipe management
   - Output buffering and flow control
   - Process monitoring and restart

3. **HTTP/SSE Connector**
   - HTTP client with connection pooling
   - SSE event stream parser
   - Authentication middleware
   - Retry with exponential backoff

4. **Command Catalog**
   - Dynamic capability discovery
   - Command registry with metadata
   - Caching layer with invalidation
   - Command validation framework

5. **Request Router**
   - Request parsing and validation
   - Server selection logic
   - Response aggregation
   - Error handling and fallbacks

### Dependencies
- Go 1.24+
- `golang.org/x/sync` for coordination
- `nhooyr.io/websocket` for potential WebSocket support
- Standard library for HTTP/SSE

### Architecture Decisions
- **Actor Model**: Each connection as independent actor
- **Circuit Breaker**: For failing connections
- **Command Pattern**: For request/response handling
- **Repository Pattern**: For command catalog

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Connect to 5+ STDIO servers concurrently
- [ ] Connect to 3+ HTTP/SSE servers concurrently
- [ ] Discover and catalog all server capabilities
- [ ] Route requests to correct server 100% accurately
- [ ] Handle server disconnection gracefully
- [ ] Support hot-reload of configuration

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Connection establishment <1 second
- [ ] Command routing overhead <5ms
- [ ] Support 10,000 commands in catalog
- [ ] Memory usage scales linearly with connections
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage for connection logic

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Work with common MCP servers (filesystem, git, etc.)
- [ ] Support official MCP test suite
- [ ] Provide connection debugging tools
- [ ] Export Prometheus metrics

## Out of Scope
- AI-powered suggestions (M03)
- Workflow execution (M03)
- Advanced security features (M04)
- Visual workflow designer (Future)

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| STDIO process management complexity | High | Implement comprehensive process monitoring |
| Network reliability issues | Medium | Implement circuit breakers and retry logic |
| Command catalog synchronization | Medium | Use event-driven updates with fallback polling |
| Resource exhaustion | High | Implement connection limits and backpressure |

## Success Metrics
- Successfully orchestrate 10+ MCP servers
- Zero connection-related data loss
- 99% uptime for established connections
- Command discovery completes in <5 seconds

## Dependencies on Other Milestones
- Requires M01 (Core Infrastructure) completion
- Blocks M03 (AI Integration & Workflows)
