- Compare suggestions across providers

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

1. **AI Integration Layer**
   - Provider abstraction interface
   - API client implementations
   - Request/response transformation
   - Token usage tracking

2. **Workflow Engine**
   - Workflow definition language
   - Execution runtime
   - State machine implementation
   - Rollback mechanism

3. **Suggestion Service**
   - Task analysis pipeline
   - Command sequence generation
   - Validation and safety checks
   - Suggestion ranking system

4. **State Persistence**
   - SQLite database schema
   - Workflow history tracking
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Template management

5. **Execution Monitor**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Progress visualization
   - Error detection and reporting
   - Performance profiling

### Dependencies
- Go 1.24+
- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` for database
- AI provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- `github.com/google/uuid` for workflow IDs

### Architecture Decisions
- **Strategy Pattern**: For AI provider selection
- **Saga Pattern**: For workflow execution
- **Event Sourcing**: For workflow state
- **Chain of Responsibility**: For command validation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Generate relevant workflows for 90%+ of tasks
- [ ] Execute workflows with 95%+ success rate
- [ ] Support workflows up to 50 steps
- [ ] Rollback failed workflows cleanly
- [ ] Persist complete workflow history
- [ ] Support 3+ AI providers

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] AI response time <5 seconds
- [ ] Workflow execution overhead <100ms per step
- [ ] Support 1000+ concurrent workflows
- [ ] Database size <100MB for 10,000 workflows
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for critical paths

### AI Quality Requirements
- [ ] Suggestion relevance score >80%
- [ ] Avoid dangerous operations by default
- [ ] Respect user-defined safety boundaries
- [ ] Learn from user modifications

## Out of Scope
- Visual workflow designer (Future)
- Workflow sharing/marketplace (Future)
- Custom AI model training (Future)
- Complex branching logic (M04)

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI hallucination/bad suggestions | High | Implement validation and safety checks |
| API rate limits | Medium | Implement caching and rate limiting |
| Workflow complexity explosion | High | Set reasonable limits and guardrails |
| State corruption | High | Implement transaction boundaries |
| AI provider downtime | Medium | Multi-provider fallback support |

## Success Metrics
- 80% of users successfully execute AI-suggested workflows
- 40% reduction in task completion time
- <2% workflow failure rate
- 90+ NPS score for AI suggestions

## Dependencies on Other Milestones
- Requires M02 (Connection Orchestration) completion
- Enables M04 (Production Features)
