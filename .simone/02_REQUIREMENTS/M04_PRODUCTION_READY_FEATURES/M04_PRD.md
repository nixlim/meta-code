   - Authentication middleware
   - Authorization framework

2. **Error Handling System**
   - Structured error types
   - Error context propagation
   - Retry mechanism with backoff
   - Error analytics collector

3. **Monitoring Infrastructure**
   - Metrics collection and export
   - Distributed tracing support
   - Custom dashboard templates
   - Alert rule definitions

4. **CLI Enhancement**
   - Interactive mode with readline
   - Command autocomplete
   - Progress indicators
   - Color-coded output

5. **Deployment Tooling**
   - Build pipeline for all platforms
   - Container image creation
   - Service installation scripts
   - Update notification system

### Dependencies
- Go 1.24+
- `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` for metrics
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` for CLI
- `github.com/fatih/color` for terminal colors
- `golang.org/x/crypto` for encryption

### Architecture Decisions
- **Decorator Pattern**: For security middleware
- **Observer Pattern**: For monitoring events
- **Builder Pattern**: For configuration
- **Template Method**: For deployment scripts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All operations have proper error handling
- [ ] Credentials never stored in plain text
- [ ] All user actions are audited
- [ ] Metrics available for all key operations
- [ ] CLI provides helpful guidance
- [ ] Deployment takes <5 minutes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] 99.9% uptime reliability
- [ ] <100ms latency for all operations
- [ ] Support 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] Pass security audit requirements
- [ ] 95%+ code coverage

### Security Requirements
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 compliance
- [ ] SOC 2 ready logging

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Regular security audits and scanning |
| Performance degradation | High | Continuous performance testing |
| Complex deployment | Medium | Extensive deployment documentation |
| Breaking changes | High | Comprehensive upgrade testing |

## Success Metrics
- Zero security incidents
- 99.9% uptime achieved
- <5 minute mean time to recovery
- >90% user satisfaction score
- <10 support tickets per week

## Dependencies on Other Milestones
- Requires M01, M02, M03 completion
- Final milestone before GA release

## Release Plan
