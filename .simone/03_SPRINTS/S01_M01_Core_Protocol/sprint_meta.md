# Sprint: MCP Protocol Foundation (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the core MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol with message routing, protocol negotiation, and initialize/initialized handshake.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- JSON-RPC 2.0 parser and serializer implementation
- MCP message routing system with proper error handling
- Protocol version negotiation mechanism
- Initialize/initialized handshake implementation
- Error responses for unsupported methods
- Basic protocol validation and schema compliance

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- All protocol messages parse and serialize correctly according to MCP spec
- Initialize/initialized handshake works with test client
- Unknown methods return proper JSON-RPC error responses
- Unit tests achieve 90%+ coverage for protocol components
- Code passes go fmt, go vet, and golint checks
- Basic documentation for protocol implementation

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This is the foundational sprint - no external dependencies
- Focus on clean interfaces to support future server implementation
- Consider using table-driven tests for protocol parsing
- No ADRs currently exist for this sprint - technical decisions documented within tasks
