# Sprint: MCP Protocol Foundation (S01)

**Status**: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS - 6/10 tasks completed (60%)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the core MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol with message routing, protocol negotiation, and initialize/initialized handshake.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- JSON-RPC 2.0 parser and serializer implementation
- MCP message routing system with proper error handling
- Protocol version negotiation mechanism
- Initialize/initialized handshake implementation
- Error responses for unsupported methods
- Basic protocol validation and schema compliance

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- All protocol messages parse and serialize correctly according to MCP spec
- Initialize/initialized handshake works with test client
- Unknown methods return proper JSON-RPC error responses
- Unit tests achieve 90%+ coverage for protocol components
- Code passes go fmt, go vet, and golint checks
- Basic documentation for protocol implementation

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This is the foundational sprint - no external dependencies
- Focus on clean interfaces to support future server implementation
- Consider using table-driven tests for protocol parsing
- No ADRs currently exist for this sprint - technical decisions documented within tasks

## Major Architecture Change (2025-07-20)
**IMPORTANT**: T02_S01 has been significantly refactored to use the mcp-go library (github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go) instead of custom MCP protocol implementation. This provides:

- **Benefits**: Standardized, battle-tested MCP implementation; automatic spec compliance; reduced maintenance burden
- **Impact**: T05_S01 and T07_S01 should leverage mcp-go's built-in capabilities rather than implementing from scratch
- **Integration**: Created wrapper package maintaining compatibility with existing JSON-RPC router
- **Status**: All tests passing, build successful, example server created
