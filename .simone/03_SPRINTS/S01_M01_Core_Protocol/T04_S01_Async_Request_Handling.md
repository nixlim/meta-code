# Task: Async Request Handling & Middleware

**Task ID:** T04_S01  
**Sprint:** S01  
**Status:** open  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Title:** Async Request Handling & Middleware Implementation

## Description
Extend the basic message router with asynchronous request/response correlation, middleware chain support, and concurrent request handling capabilities. This builds upon the basic router (T03) to provide advanced features needed for production-ready MCP protocol handling.

## Goal/Objectives
- Implement async request/response correlation
- Add middleware chain for cross-cutting concerns
- Enable concurrent request processing
- Support request context and metadata
- Provide timeout handling for long-running requests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Async handlers with request/response correlation
- [ ] Middleware can intercept requests/responses
- [ ] Concurrent requests handled safely
- [ ] Request timeouts properly enforced
- [ ] Context propagation through handler chain
- [ ] Graceful shutdown of pending requests

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement request context with metadata support
- [ ] Create async request/response correlation mechanism
- [ ] Design middleware interface and chain execution
- [ ] Add timeout handling with context cancellation
- [ ] Implement concurrent request manager
- [ ] Create middleware for logging and metrics
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown mechanism
- [ ] Write integration tests for async flows

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points:
- AsyncRouter in `internal/protocol/router/async.go`
- Middleware in `internal/protocol/router/middleware.go`
- RequestContext in `internal/protocol/router/context.go`
- Builds on basic router from T03
- Uses context.Context for lifecycle management

### Existing patterns to follow:
- Use channels for async communication
- Implement middleware as func(Handler) Handler
- Store request correlation in context
- Use sync.WaitGroup for graceful shutdown
- Apply timeout through context.WithTimeout

## Implementation Notes
1. Use goroutines for concurrent request handling
2. Implement correlation ID tracking for async responses
3. Design middleware chain similar to HTTP middleware
4. Use buffered channels to prevent blocking
5. Add request queuing for overload protection
6. Consider backpressure mechanisms
7. Ensure proper resource cleanup on shutdown
8. Add observability hooks for monitoring

## Complexity Analysis
This task has been assessed as **Medium complexity** due to:
- **Clear Patterns**: Well-established async patterns in Go
- **Focused Scope**: Builds on existing router foundation
- **Standard Concurrency**: Uses standard Go concurrency primitives
- **Manageable Testing**: Async testing is straightforward with proper design
