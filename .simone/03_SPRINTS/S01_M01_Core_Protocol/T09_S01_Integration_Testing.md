# Task: Integration Testing

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: T09_S01
- **Sprint**: S01
- **Status**: completed
- **Updated**: 2025-07-21 10:38
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: T01, T02, T03, T04, T05, T06, T07, T08

## Description
Build integration testing infrastructure including a mock MCP client and comprehensive integration test suite. This focuses on testing complete message flows, protocol interactions, and end-to-end scenarios across the entire MCP protocol stack.

## Goal/Objectives
- Create mock MCP client for testing
- Implement integration tests for all message flows
- Test protocol state transitions
- Verify timeout and error handling
- Ensure proper async request handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Mock MCP client fully implemented
- [x] Integration tests cover all protocol flows
- [x] State transition tests pass
- [x] Timeout and retry scenarios tested
- [x] Concurrent request handling verified
- [x] Error propagation tested end-to-end
- [x] Test harness supports multiple client scenarios

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement mock MCP client in `internal/testing/mcp/client.go`
- [x] Create mock server utilities in `internal/testing/mcp/server.go`
- [x] Write integration tests for initialization flow
- [x] Test request/response message flows
- [x] Test notification handling
- [x] Test error scenarios and recovery
- [x] Test concurrent request handling
- [x] Implement timeout and cancellation tests
- [x] Create test scenarios for state transitions

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points:
- Mock client in `internal/testing/mcp/client.go`
- Integration tests in `test/integration/`
- Use httptest for HTTP-based testing
- WebSocket test utilities for transport testing
- Context handling for timeout scenarios

### Existing patterns to follow:
- Use httptest.Server for mock servers
- Implement client with configurable behavior
- Create scenario-based test suites
- Use channels for async coordination
- Test both happy and error paths

## Implementation Notes
1. Mock client should support all MCP operations
2. Allow configurable responses for testing
3. Include delay simulation for timing tests
4. Test connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect)
5. Verify proper cleanup in all scenarios
6. Use goroutine leak detection
7. Test with real protocol message sequences
8. Include stress tests for concurrent operations
9. Document client usage patterns

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Task started
- [x] Mock client structure defined
- [x] Basic client operations implemented
- [x] Server test utilities created
- [x] Initialization flow tests complete
- [x] Request/response tests complete
- [x] Error handling tests complete
- [x] Concurrent operation tests complete
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Code review passed
- [x] Task completed
