# Task: Initialize/Initialized Handshake

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: T05_S01
- **Sprint**: S01
- **Status**: open
- **Complexity**: High
- **Dependencies**: T02_S01 (MCP Types), T03_S01, T04_S01 (Request Router parts)
- **Estimated Effort**: 5-8 days
- **Assignee**: TBD

## Description
Implement the MCP protocol handshake flow including the Initialize request from clients and Initialized response from servers. This establishes the protocol version and capabilities negotiation between client and server.

## Goal/Objectives
- Implement Initialize request handler
- Implement Initialized response generation
- Support protocol version negotiation
- Handle capability exchange between client/server
- Ensure proper state management during handshake

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Server accepts Initialize requests
- [ ] Server responds with Initialized containing server info
- [ ] Protocol version negotiation works correctly
- [ ] Capabilities are properly exchanged
- [ ] Server rejects requests before handshake
- [ ] Only one handshake allowed per connection
- [ ] Handshake timeout is enforced

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create InitializeHandler for the router
- [ ] Implement protocol version negotiation logic
- [ ] Create connection state manager
- [ ] Build Initialized response with server info
- [ ] Add pre-handshake request validation
- [ ] Implement handshake timeout mechanism
- [ ] Add handshake state to connection context
- [ ] Write integration tests for full handshake flow

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points:
- Handler in `internal/protocol/handlers/initialize.go`
- Connection state in `internal/protocol/connection/state.go`
- Integrate with Router from T03
- Use MCP types from T02
- Version negotiation in `internal/protocol/version/negotiator.go`

### Existing patterns to follow:
- Use finite state machine for connection states
- Store handshake state in context.Context
- Use sync.Once for single handshake enforcement
- Return specific error codes for protocol violations

## Implementation Notes
1. Design connection states: New -> Initializing -> Ready -> Closed
2. Use context values to track connection state
3. Implement version negotiation (choose highest common version)
4. Consider backward compatibility for future versions
5. Add connection metadata storage for capabilities
6. Use time.AfterFunc for handshake timeout
7. Log all handshake steps for debugging
8. Consider security implications of capability exposure

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each handler component
- Integration tests for complete handshake flow
- Concurrent connection tests
- Timeout scenario tests
- Version mismatch tests
- Invalid request sequence tests

## Architecture Considerations
- Thread-safe state transitions
- Context propagation through request chain
- Clean separation between protocol and transport layers
- Extensible design for future protocol versions

## Security Considerations
- Validate all input parameters
- Rate limit handshake attempts
- Sanitize capability information exposure
- Implement connection timeout to prevent resource exhaustion

## Notes
This task forms the foundation of the MCP protocol implementation, establishing secure, versioned connections between clients and servers. The complexity is assessed as High due to the state management requirements, protocol negotiation logic, and integration with multiple components.
