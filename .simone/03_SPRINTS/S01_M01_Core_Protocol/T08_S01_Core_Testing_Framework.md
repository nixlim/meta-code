# Task: Core Testing Framework

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: T08_S01
- **Sprint**: S01
- **Status**: open
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: T01, T02, T03, T04, T05, T06, T07

## Description
Implement the core unit testing framework and utilities for the MCP protocol implementation. This includes creating test helpers, fixtures, table-driven test patterns, and establishing testing best practices for the codebase.

## Goal/Objectives
- Create comprehensive unit test suite for all protocol components
- Implement reusable test utilities and helpers
- Establish table-driven testing patterns
- Achieve 70%+ unit test coverage
- Create test fixtures for common scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all core protocol components
- [ ] Test helper utilities implemented
- [ ] Table-driven tests for edge cases
- [ ] Test fixtures created for all message types
- [ ] Coverage reporting configured and meets 90% threshold
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- [ ] Test documentation complete

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create test helper functions in `internal/testing/helpers/`
- [ ] Implement test fixtures for message types
- [ ] Write unit tests for JSON-RPC foundation (T01)
- [ ] Write unit tests for protocol types (T02)
- [ ] Write unit tests for message router (T03)
- [ ] Write unit tests for async handling (T04)
- [ ] Write unit tests for initialization (T05)
- [ ] Write unit tests for error handling (T06, T07)
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting with go test
- [ ] Create benchmark tests for performance-critical code

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points:
- Test helpers in `internal/testing/helpers/helpers.go`
- Test fixtures in `internal/testing/fixtures/`
- Unit tests alongside implementation files (`*_test.go`)
- Benchmark tests in `*_bench_test.go` files
- Use testify/assert for assertions

### Existing patterns to follow:
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Test fixtures as JSON files in `fixtures/` directory
- Helper functions for common test setup/teardown
- Use subtests for better test organization
- Parallel test execution where appropriate

## Implementation Notes
1. Start with test helpers and common utilities
2. Create fixtures for all message types from spec
3. Use table-driven tests for exhaustive testing
4. Include both positive and negative test cases
5. Test error paths and edge cases thoroughly
6. Use `testing.T.Run()` for subtests
7. Enable race detection in tests
8. Document test utilities for team use
9. Consider test data generators for complex types

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Task started
- [ ] Test helpers implemented
- [ ] Test fixtures created
- [ ] Unit tests for T01-T02 complete
- [ ] Unit tests for T03-T04 complete
- [ ] Unit tests for T05-T07 complete
- [ ] Coverage target met
- [ ] Benchmarks implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Task completed

## Notes
- Focus on creating a solid foundation for all future testing
- Ensure tests are maintainable and self-documenting
- Keep test execution time reasonable (<30s for unit tests)
- Use build tags to separate unit and integration tests
