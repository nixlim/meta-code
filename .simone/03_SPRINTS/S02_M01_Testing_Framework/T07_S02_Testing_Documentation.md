## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: T07_S02
- **Sprint**: S02
- **Status**: planned
- **Started**: Not started
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: T01_S02, T02_S02, T03_S02, T04_S02, T05_S02, T06_S02

## Description
Create comprehensive developer testing guide with examples and best practices. This task consolidates and enhances existing testing documentation, providing a unified reference for developers working with the Meta-MCP Server testing framework. The guide should cover all aspects of testing from unit tests to integration tests, benchmarks, and debugging strategies.

## Goal/Objectives
- Consolidate existing testing documentation into a comprehensive guide
- Provide clear examples from the actual codebase
- Document testing patterns and best practices specific to this project
- Create a quick-start guide for new developers
- Establish testing standards and conventions
- Document CI/CD integration and coverage requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive testing guide created in `docs/testing-guide.md`
- [ ] Quick-start section for running tests immediately
- [ ] Complete examples using actual test code from the project
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common test failures
- [ ] Performance testing and benchmarking guide
- [ ] Mock client usage documentation with examples
- [ ] Coverage requirements and reporting documented
- [ ] Integration with main README.md updated
- [ ] All existing test documentation consolidated

## Subtasks
- [ ] Audit existing documentation (README.md, integration-testing.md, internal/testing/README.md)
- [ ] Create comprehensive `docs/testing-guide.md` structure
- [ ] Write quick-start section with essential commands
- [ ] Document unit testing patterns with code examples
- [ ] Document integration testing approach with examples
- [ ] Create mock client usage guide with scenarios
- [ ] Document benchmark testing methodology
- [ ] Write debugging and troubleshooting section
- [ ] Document coverage requirements and reporting
- [ ] Update main README.md with testing section
- [ ] Add testing checklist for contributors
- [ ] Review and validate with actual test runs

### Key Documentation Areas:
1. **Testing Commands Reference**
   - All go test variations with explanations
   - Coverage commands and interpretation
   - Benchmark and profiling commands

2. **Code Examples**
   - Use actual test files from the codebase
   - Show both good and bad practices
   - Include real test output samples

3. **Mock Client Documentation**
   - Configuration options
   - Common usage patterns
   - Integration test scenarios

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Common test failures and fixes
   - Debugging flaky tests
   - Performance issue diagnosis

### Existing Documentation to Consolidate:
- `/docs/integration-testing.md` - Integration test framework details
- `/internal/testing/README.md` - Testing utilities and patterns
- `/README.md` - Basic testing commands
- CLAUDE.md testing section - Developer commands

## Implementation Notes
1. Start by auditing all existing testing documentation
2. Create a unified structure that eliminates duplication
3. Use actual code examples from the test suite
4. Include command output examples for clarity
5. Focus on practical, actionable guidance
6. Consider creating a testing decision tree/flowchart
7. Include links to relevant test files as examples
8. Document both what to test and how to test it
9. Create templates for common test scenarios
10. Ensure documentation stays maintainable and current
