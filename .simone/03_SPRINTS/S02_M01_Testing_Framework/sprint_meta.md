# Sprint: Testing Infrastructure Setup (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Establish comprehensive testing framework with unit tests, integration tests, mock MCP client, and CI/CD pipeline.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Unit test infrastructure setup with testify framework
- Integration test framework for end-to-end testing
- Mock MCP client implementation for testing server responses
- Test coverage reporting with target of 70%+ (if possible)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Code quality tools setup (golangci-lint)
- Developer testing documentation

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Unit test framework operational with example tests
- Mock MCP client can simulate protocol interactions
- CI/CD pipeline runs on all commits and PRs
- Coverage reporting integrated and visible
- All existing code has appropriate test coverage
- Testing guide documented for developers

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Early testing setup enables TDD for remaining sprints
- Mock client will be valuable for all future development
- Consider property-based testing for protocol edge cases
