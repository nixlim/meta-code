# Sprint: Testing Infrastructure Setup (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Establish comprehensive testing framework with unit tests, integration tests, mock MCP client, and CI/CD pipeline.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Unit test infrastructure setup with testify framework
- Integration test framework for end-to-end testing
- Mock MCP client implementation for testing server responses
- Test coverage reporting with target of 70%+ (if possible)
- Code quality tools setup (golangci-lint)
- Developer testing documentation

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Unit test framework operational with example tests
- Mock MCP client can simulate protocol interactions
- Coverage reporting integrated and visible
- All existing code has appropriate test coverage
- Testing guide documented for developers

## Sprint Tasks

### Testing Infrastructure (Foundation)
1. **T01_S02 - Testing Infrastructure Setup** (Complexity: Medium)
   - Establish base testing framework with testify
   - Configure test utilities and patterns
   - Set up test command structure

### Test Implementation (Core Coverage)
2. **T02_S02 - Unit Test Suite Implementation** (Complexity: High)
   - Comprehensive unit tests for core components
   - Focus on handlers (42.2%) and mcp (63.9%) packages
   - Achieve 80%+ coverage for all packages

3. **T03_S02 - Mock MCP Client Implementation** (Complexity: Medium)
   - Build mock client using mcp-go library types
   - Support protocol interaction testing
   - References ADR001 for mcp-go integration

4. **T04_S02 - Integration Test Framework** (Complexity: Medium)
   - End-to-end testing framework
   - Full protocol flow validation
   - Concurrent connection testing

### Quality & Reporting
5. **T05_S02 - Test Coverage Configuration** (Complexity: Medium)
   - Coverage reporting infrastructure
   - CI/CD integration preparation
   - 70%+ coverage enforcement

6. **T06_S02 - Code Quality Tools Setup** (Complexity: Medium-High)
   - Configure golangci-lint
   - Pre-commit hooks setup
   - Code quality standards enforcement

### Documentation
7. **T07_S02 - Testing Documentation** (Complexity: Low)
   - Developer testing guide
   - Best practices documentation
   - Example test patterns

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Early testing setup enables TDD for remaining sprints
- Mock client will be valuable for all future development
- Consider property-based testing for protocol edge cases
- T03 leverages ADR001 decision to use mcp-go library
