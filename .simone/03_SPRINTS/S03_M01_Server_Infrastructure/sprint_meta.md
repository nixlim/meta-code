# Sprint: Server Implementation (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Implement TCP/HTTP server with connection lifecycle management, concurrent request handling, and graceful shutdown.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- TCP server setup listening on configured port
- HTTP server with proper routing (future HTTP/SSE support)
- Connection lifecycle management (accept, handle, close)
- Concurrent request handling with goroutines
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT signals
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Basic monitoring hooks and health checks
- Performance validation (<10ms response time)

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Server starts and accepts connections on configured port
- Handles multiple concurrent connections without blocking
- Graceful shutdown completes within 30 seconds
- All connections properly closed on shutdown
- Logging captures key server events
- Integration tests verify server behavior
- Memory usage stays under 50MB for idle server

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Depends on S01 protocol implementation
- Design for future HTTP/SSE transport support
- Consider connection pooling for scalability
