# Project Manifest: Meta-MCP Server

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the Meta-MCP Server project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

The Meta-MCP Server is an orchestration platform that aggregates multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to create intelligent, AI-driven development workflows. It acts as both an MCP client (connecting to multiple MCP servers) and an MCP server (exposing a unified interface to AI coding agents).

**Key Value Proposition:**
- Workflow orchestration across multiple MCP servers
- AI-powered command sequence suggestions
- Local-first security architecture
- 40-60% reduction in development workflow setup time

This project follows a milestone-based development approach with four major milestones leading to production release.

## 2. Current Focus

- **Milestone:** M01 - MVP Foundation - Core Infrastructure
- **Sprint:** S01 - MCP Protocol Foundation (Ready to start)
- **Sprint Planning:** Complete - 4 sprints planned for M01
