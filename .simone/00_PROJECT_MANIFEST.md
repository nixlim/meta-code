# Project Manifest: Meta-MCP Server

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the Meta-MCP Server project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

The Meta-MCP Server is an orchestration platform that aggregates multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to create intelligent, AI-driven development workflows. It acts as both an MCP client (connecting to multiple MCP servers) and an MCP server (exposing a unified interface to AI coding agents).

**Key Value Proposition:**
- Workflow orchestration across multiple MCP servers
- AI-powered command sequence suggestions
- Local-first security architecture
- 40-60% reduction in development workflow setup time

This project follows a milestone-based development approach with four major milestones leading to production release.

## 2. Current Focus

- **Milestone:** M01 - MVP Foundation - Core Infrastructure
- **Sprint:** S01 - MCP Protocol Foundation (IN PROGRESS - 9/10 tasks completed)
- **Current Task:** T10_S01 - Protocol Conformance (IN PROGRESS - 2025-07-21 13:10)
- **Sprint Planning:** Complete - 4 sprints planned for M01
- **Recent Achievement:** Integrated mcp-go library for standardized MCP implementation

## 3. Recent Architectural Decision: mcp-go Integration

**Date:** 2025-07-20
**Decision:** Integrate github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go library instead of custom MCP implementation

**Rationale:**
- Provides battle-tested, specification-compliant MCP implementation
- Reduces development time and maintenance burden
- Ensures automatic compliance with MCP protocol updates
- Allows focus on core business logic rather than protocol details

**Impact:**
- **T02_S01:** Refactored to use mcp-go with wrapper package for convenience
- **T05_S01 & T07_S01:** Can leverage mcp-go's built-in capabilities
- **Technical Debt:** Significantly reduced by using standardized library
- **Development Speed:** Accelerated protocol implementation phase

**Status:** âœ… Completed - All tests passing, build successful, example server created
