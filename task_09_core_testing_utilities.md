# Task 09: Core Testing Utilities & Unit Test Framework

**Task ID:** TASK-09  
**Task Name:** Core Testing Utilities & Unit Test Framework  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Created:** 2025-07-20  
**Dependencies:** 
- TASK-01: Core MCP Protocol Implementation (provides protocol components to test)
- TASK-02: Configuration Management System (provides config validation to test)

---

## Overview

Establish comprehensive unit testing framework and core testing utilities for the Meta-MCP Server. This task focuses on creating the foundational testing infrastructure that ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability across all components.

## Objectives

1. Set up Go testing framework with proper structure and conventions
2. Create testing utilities and helper functions for common test scenarios
3. Implement mock objects and test doubles for isolated unit testing
4. Establish code coverage tooling and reporting
5. Define testing standards and best practices for the project

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Testing Framework Setup
- Configure Go testing environment with proper package structure
- Set up test data fixtures and test configuration management
- Implement test lifecycle management (setup/teardown)
- Create test runner scripts for different test suites

### 2. Core Testing Utilities
- **Mock Generators**: Create utilities for generating mock MCP messages
- **Test Helpers**: Common assertion functions and comparison utilities
- **Data Builders**: Test data builders for complex objects (configs, messages, etc.)
- **Time Utilities**: Controllable time sources for deterministic testing
- **IO Mocking**: Mock readers/writers for testing IO operations

### 3. Mock Objects & Test Doubles
- **Mock MCP Server**: Lightweight mock server for protocol testing
- **Mock Transport**: Test doubles for STDIO and HTTP/SSE transports
- **Mock AI Client**: Simulated AI API responses for workflow testing
- **Mock File System**: In-memory file system for configuration testing

### 4. Code Coverage Infrastructure
- Integrate Go coverage tools (`go test -cover`)
- Set up coverage reporting with HTML output
- Configure coverage thresholds (target: >80%)
- Create coverage badges and reports for CI/CD
- Implement coverage tracking over time

### 5. Testing Standards
- Define unit test naming conventions
- Establish test organization patterns
- Create testing guidelines documentation
- Set up test categorization (unit, integration, performance)

### Key Testing Patterns
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive input coverage
- Subtests for logical test grouping
- Parallel test execution where appropriate
- Property-based testing for protocol validation

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for all packages
- 100% coverage for critical paths (security, protocol handling)
- Coverage reports integrated into PR process
- Historical coverage tracking

## Implementation Steps

1. **Week 1: Framework Setup**
   - Set up test directory structure
   - Configure coverage tooling
   - Create base test utilities

2. **Week 2: Mock Development**
   - Implement core mock objects
   - Create test data builders
   - Develop assertion helpers

3. **Week 3: Standards & Documentation**
   - Write testing guidelines
   - Create example tests
   - Set up CI integration

4. **Week 4: Coverage & Optimization**
   - Achieve coverage targets
   - Optimize test execution time
   - Create coverage reporting

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Go test framework properly configured with clear structure
- [ ] Comprehensive mock objects available for all external dependencies
- [ ] Test utilities reduce boilerplate and improve test readability
- [ ] Code coverage reporting automated and integrated with CI
- [ ] >80% code coverage achieved across all packages
- [ ] Testing standards documented and followed
- [ ] Test execution time <30 seconds for unit test suite
- [ ] All tests run reliably without flakiness

## Related Tasks

- **Depends On**: TASK-01 (Protocol Implementation), TASK-02 (Configuration)
- **Blocks**: TASK-10 (Integration Testing), TASK-11 (Protocol Validation)
- **Related To**: All implementation tasks that require testing

## Notes

- Focus on making tests maintainable and readable
- Prioritize testing of business logic and error paths
- Ensure mocks accurately represent real behavior
- Consider using `testify` or similar assertion libraries
- Plan for future test parallelization needs
