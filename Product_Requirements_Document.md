## 5. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)

### 5.1 Core MCP Protocol Implementation

```gherkin
Feature: MCP Protocol Implementation
  As a developer using Meta-MCP Server
  I want the server to correctly implement MCP protocol
  So that it can communicate with MCP servers and clients

  Background:
    Given a Meta-MCP Server instance is running
    And the server has loaded a valid configuration

  Scenario: Initialize MCP client connection
    Given an MCP server is available at the configured endpoint
    When Meta-MCP attempts to establish a client connection
    Then the connection should be established successfully
    And the server capabilities should be discovered
    And the command catalog should be updated with available tools

  Scenario: Handle MCP server requests as a server
    Given Meta-MCP is configured to act as an MCP server
    And an external MCP client connects to Meta-MCP
    When the client sends an initialize request
    Then Meta-MCP should respond with its capabilities
    And the client should be able to list available tools
    And the client should be able to invoke aggregated commands

  Scenario: Protocol error handling
    Given an MCP server sends an invalid JSON-RPC message
    When Meta-MCP receives the malformed message
    Then it should respond with an appropriate error code
    And it should log the error for debugging
    And it should not crash or become unresponsive
```

### 5.2 Multi-Server Connection Management

```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Server Connection Management
  As a developer orchestrating multiple tools
  I want to connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
  So that I can use all my development tools in unified workflows

  Background:
    Given a configuration file with multiple MCP servers defined
    And Meta-MCP Server is started with this configuration

  Scenario: Connect to multiple STDIO servers
    Given the configuration includes 3 STDIO MCP servers
    When Meta-MCP starts up
    Then it should spawn 3 separate subprocesses
    And it should establish JSON-RPC communication with each
    And all 3 servers should appear as "connected" in the status

  Scenario: Connect to HTTP/SSE servers
    Given the configuration includes 2 HTTP MCP servers
    When Meta-MCP attempts to connect
    Then it should establish HTTP connections to both servers
    And it should handle Server-Sent Events from each server
    And both servers should be available for command execution

  Scenario: Handle connection failures gracefully
    Given one configured MCP server is unavailable
    When Meta-MCP attempts to connect to all servers
    Then it should successfully connect to available servers
    And it should log an error for the unavailable server
    And it should continue to retry connection periodically
    And available servers should remain functional
```

### 5.3 AI-Powered Workflow Suggestions

```gherkin
Feature: AI-Powered Workflow Suggestions
  As a developer describing a task
  I want AI to suggest optimal command sequences
  So that I can complete complex workflows efficiently

  Background:
    Given Meta-MCP is connected to multiple MCP servers
    And AI API credentials are configured
    And the command catalog contains available tools

  Scenario: Generate workflow suggestions for a development task
    Given I describe a task: "Refactor the authentication function in src/auth.py"
    When I request AI workflow suggestions
    Then the AI should analyze the available commands
    And it should generate a logical sequence of operations
    And the sequence should include: reading the file, analyzing code, generating improvements, and writing changes
    And the response should be received within 3 seconds

  Scenario: Handle AI API failures gracefully
    Given the AI API is temporarily unavailable
    When I request workflow suggestions
    Then Meta-MCP should attempt the AI call with timeout
    And it should provide a fallback response with manual options
    And it should log the API failure for monitoring
    And it should not block other operations

  Scenario: Validate AI suggestions against available commands
    Given the AI suggests using a command that doesn't exist
    When the workflow suggestion is processed
    Then Meta-MCP should validate each suggested command
    And it should either find alternatives or request clarification
    And it should not include invalid commands in the final suggestion
```

### 5.4 Workflow Execution Engine

```gherkin
Feature: Workflow Execution Engine
  As a developer executing complex workflows
  I want reliable execution of command sequences
  So that my development tasks are completed correctly

  Background:
    Given Meta-MCP has a valid workflow to execute
    And all required MCP servers are connected
    And the workflow contains multiple commands across different servers

  Scenario: Execute sequential workflow successfully
    Given a workflow with 4 sequential commands
    When I execute the workflow
    Then commands should execute in the correct order
    And each command should complete before the next begins
    And the results should be aggregated and returned
    And the execution should complete within the expected timeframe

  Scenario: Handle workflow execution errors
    Given a workflow where the 2nd command will fail
    When I execute the workflow
    Then the 1st command should execute successfully
    And the 2nd command should fail with a clear error message
    And the workflow should stop execution after the failure
    And I should be offered options to retry or modify the workflow

  Scenario: Execute parallel workflow optimization
    Given a workflow with commands that can run in parallel
    When I execute the workflow with parallel optimization enabled
    Then independent commands should execute concurrently
    And dependent commands should wait for prerequisites
    And the total execution time should be less than sequential execution
    And all results should be correctly aggregated
```

### 5.5 Security and Access Control

```gherkin
Feature: Security and Access Control
  As a security-conscious developer
  I want secure handling of credentials and operations
  So that my development environment remains protected

  Background:
    Given Meta-MCP is configured with security settings enabled
    And credential management is set to environment variables only

  Scenario: Secure credential handling
    Given API credentials are set via environment variables
    When Meta-MCP starts up
    Then credentials should be loaded into memory only
    And credentials should never be written to disk
    And credentials should not appear in logs or error messages
    And credentials should be cleared from memory on shutdown

  Scenario: User consent for sensitive operations
    Given a workflow includes a file write operation
    When the workflow execution reaches the write command
    Then Meta-MCP should prompt for user consent
    And the operation should proceed only after explicit approval
    And the consent decision should be logged for audit
    And the user should be able to deny the operation safely

  Scenario: TLS encryption for network communications
    Given Meta-MCP is communicating with remote MCP servers
    When network connections are established
    Then all communications should use TLS 1.3
    And certificate validation should be enforced
    And unencrypted connections should be rejected
    And connection security should be logged
```

### 5.6 Configuration Management

```gherkin
Feature: Configuration Management
  As a developer setting up Meta-MCP
  I want flexible and reliable configuration management
  So that I can easily customize and maintain my setup

  Background:
    Given Meta-MCP configuration directory exists at ~/.meta-mcp/

  Scenario: Load valid configuration on startup
    Given a valid config.json file exists with 2 MCP servers
    When Meta-MCP starts up
    Then the configuration should be parsed successfully
    And connections should be attempted to both servers
    And the configuration should be validated for required fields
    And any environment variables should be substituted correctly

  Scenario: Handle configuration validation errors
    Given a config.json file with invalid JSON syntax
    When Meta-MCP attempts to start
    Then it should fail to start with a clear error message
    And the error should indicate the specific syntax problem
    And the error should include the line number if possible
    And it should suggest how to fix the configuration

  Scenario: Dynamic configuration reloading
    Given Meta-MCP is running with an initial configuration
    When I modify the config.json file to add a new server
    And I send a SIGHUP signal to the process
    Then Meta-MCP should reload the configuration
    And it should attempt to connect to the new server
    And existing connections should remain unaffected
    And the reload result should be logged
```
