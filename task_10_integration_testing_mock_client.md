## Overview

Develop comprehensive integration testing framework and a fully-featured mock MCP client for testing the Meta-MCP Server's multi-server orchestration capabilities. This task focuses on testing component interactions, end-to-end workflows, and creating realistic test scenarios.

## Objectives

1. Build integration test harness for testing multiple components together
2. Create a mock MCP client that can simulate real MCP host behavior
3. Implement integration test scenarios for key user workflows
4. Develop tools for testing distributed system behaviors
5. Establish integration testing best practices and patterns

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Integration Test Harness
- Framework for spinning up full Meta-MCP Server instances
- Test environment management (isolated configs, ports, etc.)
- Multi-server test orchestration capabilities
- Integration test lifecycle management
- Test data cleanup and isolation

### 2. Mock MCP Client Implementation
- **Full Protocol Support**: Complete MCP client implementation for testing
- **Behavior Simulation**: Configurable client behaviors and responses
- **Error Injection**: Ability to simulate various failure scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Controllable latency and throughput
- **State Verification**: Tools to verify server state from client perspective

### 3. Integration Test Scenarios
- **Multi-Server Workflows**: Test orchestration across multiple MCP servers
- **Connection Management**: Test connection lifecycle, failures, and recovery
- **Workflow Execution**: End-to-end workflow testing with real commands
- **Configuration Changes**: Dynamic configuration updates and reloading
- **Security Scenarios**: Authentication, authorization, and encryption testing

### 4. Test Infrastructure
- Docker containers for isolated test environments
- Network simulation for testing distributed scenarios
- Load generation tools for stress testing
- Test result aggregation and reporting
- CI/CD integration for automated testing

### 5. Testing Patterns
- Scenario-based testing for user journeys
- Chaos engineering principles for resilience testing
- Performance benchmarking framework
- Regression test suite management

## Technical Specifications

### Mock Client Architecture
```go
type MockMCPClient struct {
    // Configurable behavior
    ResponseDelay    time.Duration
    ErrorRate        float64
    Capabilities     []Capability
    
    // State tracking
    ReceivedMessages []Message
    ConnectionState  State
    
    // Control interface
    SimulateFailure(error)
    SetResponseBehavior(pattern)
}
```
