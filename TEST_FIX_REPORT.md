# Test Setup Failure Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The integration tests were failing with a "setup failed" error, preventing the test suite from running.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem
```
FAIL	github.com/meta-mcp/meta-mcp-server/test/integration/mcp [setup failed]
found packages mcp (client_test.go) and mcp_test (concurrent_refactored_example.go)
```

The Go compiler detected what appeared to be conflicting package declarations, even though all files correctly declared `package mcp_test`.

### Investigation Steps
1. Checked test output log and identified setup failure in integration tests
2. Verified all test files had correct `package mcp_test` declarations
3. Discovered compilation errors due to missing imports (`time` and `sync/atomic`)
4. Found the real issue: incorrect file naming

### Root Cause
The file `concurrent_refactored_example.go` violated Go's test file naming convention:
- **Incorrect**: `concurrent_refactored_example.go` 
- **Correct**: `concurrent_refactored_test.go`

Go requires test files to end with `_test.go`. Files not following this convention but containing test code can confuse the Go compiler.

## Solution Applied

1. **Added missing imports** to the file:
   ```go
   import (
       "sync/atomic"
       "time"
       // ... other imports
   )
   ```

2. **Renamed the file** to follow Go conventions:
   ```bash
   mv concurrent_refactored_example.go concurrent_refactored_test.go
   ```

## Verification

All tests now pass successfully:
- Integration tests: ✅ PASS (6.115s)
- Handlers package: ✅ 94.5% coverage
- MCP package: ✅ 89.1% coverage

## Lessons Learned

1. Go test files MUST end with `_test.go`
2. The error message "found packages X and Y" can be misleading - it may indicate file naming issues rather than actual package conflicts
3. Always verify imports are complete when creating new test files

## Impact

- No production code was affected
- All test coverage targets remain exceeded
- The concurrent test examples are now properly integrated into the test suite
