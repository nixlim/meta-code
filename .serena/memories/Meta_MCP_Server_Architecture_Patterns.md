# Meta-MCP Server Architecture Patterns

## System Architecture Overview

The Meta-MCP Server implements a sophisticated orchestration platform that aggregates multiple MCP servers through a unified interface, enhanced with AI-driven workflow intelligence and Claude command-based development.

## Core Architecture Layers

### 1. AI Coding Agent Layer (Top)
- Claude Code connects as MCP client
- Utilizes command-based development workflow
- Orchestrates development through `.claude/commands/`

### 2. Meta-MCP Server Core (Middle)
Three primary sublayers:

#### Protocol Layer
- **MCP Handler**: Processes MCP protocol messages
- **JSONRPC Codec**: Handles JSON-RPC 2.0 encoding/decoding
- **Message Router**: Routes messages with correlation tracking

#### Orchestration Layer
- **Workflow Engine**: State machine-based execution
- **Command Catalog**: Dynamic command aggregation
- **State Manager**: Workflow state persistence

#### Integration Layer
- **AI Integrator**: OpenAI and multi-provider support
- **Storage Manager**: BoltDB persistence layer
- **Config Manager**: Hot-reloadable configuration

### 3. MCP Server Connections (Bottom)
- Multiple concurrent connections
- Various server types (File, Git, Code Execution, etc.)
- Transport abstraction (STDIO, HTTP/SSE)

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Protocol Handler Pattern
**Location**: `/internal/protocol/`

Implements layered protocol processing:
- Low-level JSON-RPC in `jsonrpc/`
- MCP-specific handling in `mcp/`
- Async routing in `router/`
- Request processing in `handlers/`

**Key Interfaces**:
```go
type Handler interface {
    HandleRequest(ctx context.Context, req *Request) (*Response, error)
}

type Router interface {
    Route(ctx context.Context, msg Message) error
    RegisterHandler(method string, handler Handler)
}
```

### 2. Connection Management Pattern
**Features**:
- Concurrent goroutine-based handling
- Connection pooling with limits
- Health monitoring with heartbeats
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- State tracking per connection

**Implementation**:
- Transport abstraction for different protocols
- Context-based lifecycle management
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 3. Command Aggregation Pattern
**Design**:
- Real-time discovery from connected servers
- Namespace isolation prevents conflicts
- Priority-based conflict resolution
- LRU caching for performance
- Version compatibility checking

### 4. Workflow Execution Pattern
**State Machine Design**:
- Defined states: Pending, Running, Paused, Completed, Failed
- Checkpoint-based recovery
- Sequential and parallel execution modes
- Error handling with rollback capability
- Progress monitoring and reporting

### 5. Error Handling Pattern
**Structured Approach**:
- Error wrapping with context preservation
- MCP-compliant error responses
- Standardized error codes (e.g., -32011)
- Logging integration at all levels
- Recovery strategies per error type

### 6. Testing Pattern
**Comprehensive Framework**:
- Table-driven test design
- Builder pattern for test data
- Fixture-based test scenarios
- Mock implementations for isolation
- Concurrent testing utilities

## Development Orchestration Pattern

### Claude Command System
**Location**: `.claude/commands/`

Organized by function:
- `coordination/`: Swarm initialization and management
- `automation/`: Agent spawning and workflow automation
- `analysis/`: Performance and bottleneck analysis
- `github/`: Repository and PR management
- `sparc/`: Specialized development modes

### Swarm-Based Development
- Hierarchical agent topology
- Specialized agents (coder, analyst, tester, etc.)
- Task orchestration across agents
- Automated code review
- Performance optimization

## Critical Implementation Paths

### 1. Request Flow
```
Client → JSONRPC Decode → Validate → Route → Handler → Execute → Response → JSONRPC Encode → Client
```

### 2. Connection Lifecycle
```
Discovery → Connect → Handshake → Initialize → Ready → Active → Disconnect → Cleanup
```

### 3. Workflow Execution
```
Define → Validate → Schedule → Execute → Monitor → Complete/Fail → Persist → Report
```

### 4. Command Discovery
```
Connect → Query Capabilities → Aggregate → Resolve Conflicts → Cache → Serve
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Async Processing**: Non-blocking request handling
2. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections efficiently
3. **Caching Layer**: LRU cache for command catalog
4. **Batch Operations**: Group related requests
5. **Context Cancellation**: Proper cleanup on timeout

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**: Secure storage per server
2. **User Consent**: Explicit prompts for sensitive operations
3. **TLS Support**: Encrypted communication channels
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete operation history
5. **Subprocess Sandboxing**: Isolation for security

## Scalability Design

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple Meta-MCP instances
2. **Connection Limits**: Configurable per instance
3. **Resource Pooling**: Shared resources across workflows
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across servers
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle server failures

## Future Architecture Considerations

1. **Plugin System**: Dynamic loading of extensions
2. **Distributed Mode**: Multi-node deployment
3. **Event Streaming**: Real-time event propagation
4. **GraphQL API**: Alternative query interface
5. **WebSocket Support**: Bidirectional streaming
