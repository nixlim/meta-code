# Meta-MCP Server Project State - July 2025

## Project Overview
Meta-MCP Server is an MCP orchestration platform that aggregates multiple MCP servers through a unified interface with AI-driven workflow intelligence.

## Current Development State

### Completed Components
1. **Protocol Layer** - Full JSONRPC and MCP implementation with 85%+ coverage
2. **Testing Infrastructure** - Comprehensive test utilities, fixtures, and helpers
3. **Router & Handlers** - Async message handling with 87-94% coverage
4. **Development Tooling** - Claude command system in `.claude/commands/`

### Test Coverage Status
- JSONRPC: 93.5%
- Handlers: 94.5%
- MCP: 89.1%
- Router: 87.4%
- Connection: 87.0%
- Validator: 84.3%
- Errors: 83.3%

### Recent Changes
1. **Control Structure Refactor** - Added extensive Claude command system organized by category
2. **Code Review Implementation** - Fixed error code inconsistencies, removed duplicate helpers
3. **Testing Enhancements** - Added concurrent testing utilities, mock MCP client/server
4. **Development Workflow** - Integrated swarm-based development with Serena MCP

### Key Architecture Patterns
- Modular layered architecture
- Protocol handler pattern with clear separation
- Connection pooling with health monitoring
- Command aggregation with conflict resolution
- State machine workflow execution
- Swarm-based development orchestration

### Next Steps
1. Complete T11 Protocol Conformance Testing
2. Begin T03 Multi-Server Connection Management
3. Implement schema validation (currently 0% coverage)
4. Enhance edge case testing scenarios

### Development Workflow
- Command-based development via `.claude/commands/`
- Swarm agent coordination for complex tasks
- Memory bank in `/memory-bank/` for context persistence
- Serena MCP for code navigation
- Activity logging in `.claude-updates`
