# Memory Bank Initialization - Meta-MCP Server

## Overview
The memory bank for the Meta-MCP Server project has been initialized with all core files. This memory bank structure is crucial for maintaining context across Claude Code sessions.

## Memory Bank Files Created
1. **projectbrief.md** - Foundation document defining the Meta-MCP Server as an MCP orchestration platform
2. **productContext.md** - Explains why the project exists (30-40% dev time on workflow coordination)
3. **activeContext.md** - Current focus on testing infrastructure (T01_S02 and T02_S02 completed)
4. **systemPatterns.md** - Layered architecture with Protocol, Orchestration, and Integration layers
5. **techContext.md** - Go 1.24.2, Darwin platform, comprehensive testing framework
6. **progress.md** - Completed: protocol layer, testing infrastructure; Next: multi-server connections

## Key Project Status
- **Phase**: Active development, focusing on testing infrastructure
- **Test Coverage**: JSONRPC (93.7%), Errors (100%), MCP (78.6%)
- **Architecture**: Modular Go implementation with concurrent server management
- **Next Tasks**: T03 Multi-Server Connection Management, T04 Command Catalog System

## Important Patterns
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Builder pattern for test data construction
- Error wrapping with context
- Goroutines for concurrent operations
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol implementation

The memory bank serves as the single source of truth for project context between sessions.
