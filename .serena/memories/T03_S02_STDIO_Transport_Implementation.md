# T03_S02: STDIO Transport Implementation

## Overview
Completed implementation of STDIO transport for subprocess MCP servers as part of T03 (Multi-Server Connection Management).

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. STDIOTransport (`internal/protocol/transport/stdio.go`)
- Full implementation of `jsonrpc.Transport` interface
- Process lifecycle management with graceful shutdown
- Concurrent-safe message sending/receiving with mutex protection
- Stderr monitoring for debugging subprocess issues
- Context-aware operations with timeout support

### 2. JSON Codec (`internal/protocol/transport/stdio.go`)
- JSON message encoding/decoding
- Batch message support
- Integration with jsonrpc.ParseMessage for type detection

### 3. Connection Manager (`internal/protocol/transport/manager.go`)
- Multi-transport management system
- Support for different transport types (STDIO, HTTP planned)
- Health checking and monitoring
- Broadcast messaging to all connections
- Connection restart capability

## Technical Highlights

### Process Management
- Proper subprocess lifecycle handling
- Graceful shutdown with 5-second timeout
- Process exit detection and error reporting
- Prevention of zombie processes

### Concurrency Safety
- Write mutex for concurrent Send operations
- Read-write mutex for connection state
- Safe process wait with sync.Once
- Thread-safe error channel management

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Process exit detection
- Broken pipe handling
- Context cancellation support

## Test Coverage
- Achieved 85.1% test coverage
- Unit tests for all major components
- Integration tests with real subprocesses
- Concurrent operation tests
- Error scenario coverage
