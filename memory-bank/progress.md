## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. **Transport Package Build Failure:** Critical - Cannot assign to struct field in map (manager.go:259-261)
2. **Schema Package Coverage:** Currently at 0%, needs implementation
3. **Logging Package Coverage:** At 22%, needs significant improvement
4. **Integration Tests:** Good progress but need more edge case scenarios
5. **Performance Optimization:** Connection handling needs optimization for 50+ servers
6. **Documentation:** Need to document control structure refactor

### Bugs to Fix
1. **Transport Build Error:** NEW - Struct field assignment in map issue blocking builds
2. **Race Condition:** Fixed in async router, verified with tests
3. **Error Messages:** Improved with standardized error codes
4. **Memory Leaks:** Potential goroutine leaks in error scenarios (under investigation)

### Documentation Gaps
1. **API Documentation:** Need comprehensive godoc comments
2. **Architecture Docs:** Need detailed component diagrams
3. **User Guide:** Installation and configuration guide needed
4. **Command System Docs:** Document new control structure

## Evolution of Decisions

### Architecture Changes
1. **Initial Design:** Monolithic server → **Current:** Modular components
2. **Protocol Handling:** Custom implementation → **Current:** Spec-compliant JSONRPC
3. **Testing Approach:** Basic tests → **Current:** Comprehensive test framework

### Technology Choices
1. **Storage:** Initially considered Redis → **Decision:** BoltDB for simplicity
2. **HTTP Framework:** Considered Gin → **Decision:** Standard library for fewer dependencies
3. **AI Integration:** Direct implementation → **Decision:** Provider abstraction layer

### Process Improvements
1. **Testing First:** Moved to test-driven development
2. **Coverage Goals:** Established per-package targets
3. **Code Review:** Implemented automated review with swarm agents
4. **Command-Based Development:** Introduced Claude command system
5. **Memory Management:** Integrated Serena MCP for code navigation
6. **Workflow Automation:** Set up orchestrated development patterns
7. **Control Structure:** Refactored for improved efficiency (July 2025)
