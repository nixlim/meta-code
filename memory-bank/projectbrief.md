# Meta-MCP Server Project Brief

## Project Overview
Meta-MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) orchestration platform that aggregates multiple MCP servers to create intelligent, composable development workflows. It acts as both an MCP client (connecting to other servers) and an MCP server (exposing aggregated functionality to AI agents).

## Core Purpose
Enable AI-driven automation for complex development tasks by orchestrating multiple specialized MCP servers through a unified interface, with intelligent workflow suggestions powered by external AI APIs.

## Key Requirements

### Must Have (MVP)
1. **Core MCP Protocol Implementation**
   - Complete JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol support
   - Client and server role implementation
   - Protocol negotiation and capability discovery

2. **Multi-Server Connectivity**
   - STDIO transport (subprocess management)
   - HTTP/SSE transport (network connections)
   - Connection lifecycle management
   - Concurrent connection handling

3. **Command Catalog System**
   - Aggregate tools/resources/prompts from all connected servers
   - Real-time catalog updates
   - Conflict resolution
   - Search and filtering

4. **AI-Powered Workflow Engine**
   - OpenAI GPT integration for workflow suggestions
   - Context-aware command sequence generation
   - Workflow execution with state management
   - Error handling and recovery

5. **Security & Local-First Architecture**
   - Secure credential management (environment variables only)
   - User consent prompts for sensitive operations
   - TLS encryption for all communications
   - Local-only data storage

### Success Metrics
- 1,000+ active developers within 6 months
- >95% workflow success rate
- <15 minutes time-to-first-workflow
- >80% AI suggestion accuracy
- <2 seconds average command routing time

## Target Users
- **Primary:** Full-stack developers using multiple development tools
- **Secondary:** DevOps engineers managing development workflows
- **Tertiary:** AI coding agent users (Claude Code, etc.)

## Technical Stack
- **Language:** Go 1.24.2+
- **Concurrency:** Goroutines for multi-server management
- **Storage:** BoltDB for local state persistence
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API (with multi-provider support planned)
- **Configuration:** JSON with environment variable substitution

## Development Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** MVP Foundation - Core functionality
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Market Fit - Enhanced workflows and integrations
- **Phase 3 (Months 7-12):** Scale & Enterprise - Advanced features

## Key Differentiators
1. First-of-its-kind MCP orchestration solution
2. AI-driven workflow intelligence
3. Local-first security model
4. Seamless integration with AI coding agents
5. Hybrid AI + rule-based workflow support
