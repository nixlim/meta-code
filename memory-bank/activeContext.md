   - Add performance benchmarks for protocol operations
   - Ensure 100% schema validation coverage

2. **Begin Core Feature Implementation**
   - Start T03 - Multi-Server Connection Management
   - Implement connection pooling and health monitoring
   - Add support for both STDIO and HTTP/SSE transports

3. **Enhance Testing Coverage**
   - Increase router package coverage to >82%
   - Add more edge case testing for error scenarios
   - Implement stress testing for concurrent operations

### Active Decisions & Considerations

1. **Testing Philosophy**
   - Prioritizing comprehensive test coverage before feature implementation
   - Using table-driven tests for better maintainability
   - Focusing on real-world scenario testing

2. **Architecture Patterns**
   - Using builder pattern for test data construction
   - Implementing proper context handling for async operations
   - Maintaining clear separation between unit and integration tests

3. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Enforcing >80% test coverage for all new code
   - Using consistent error handling patterns
   - Following Go best practices and idioms

### Important Patterns & Preferences

1. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent use of error wrapping with context
   - Proper error type definitions for different scenarios
   - Clear error messages for debugging
   - Standardized error codes with named constants

2. **Testing Patterns**
   - Table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
   - Builder pattern for complex test data
   - Separate test packages for better isolation
   - Centralized test utilities in `test/testutil/`

3. **Code Organization**
   - Clear package boundaries with well-defined interfaces
   - Minimal external dependencies
   - Modular design for easy testing
   - Command-based development workflow with `.claude/commands/`

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Claude command system for orchestrated development
   - Swarm-based agent coordination for complex tasks
   - Automated code review and quality checks
   - Integrated memory management with Serena MCP

### Learnings & Insights

1. **Concurrency Challenges**
   - Race conditions in async router required careful mutex usage
   - Context cancellation needs proper cleanup handling
   - Goroutine lifecycle management is critical

2. **Testing Best Practices**
   - Fixtures greatly improve test maintainability
   - Helper functions reduce test code duplication
   - Mock implementations should match real behavior closely

3. **Protocol Implementation**
   - Strict adherence to MCP specification is crucial
   - Schema validation catches many issues early
   - Comprehensive error handling improves robustness
